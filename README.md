# Financial-Risk-and-Travel-Behavior
This project applies machine learning techniques to two datasets:
#### Financial Risk Profiling – Predicting loan default risk.
#### Travel Behavior Insights – Predicting tourist spending categories.

Both datasets were processed and evaluated using multiple machine learning models like Clustering (K-means, DBSCAN, GMM), logistic regression, SVM, neural networks, boosting algorithms such as catboost and XGBooost to identify the best-performing approach for their respective prediction tasks. The project demonstrates end-to-end ML workflow including preprocessing, modeling, evaluation, and prediction generation.
